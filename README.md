## Project Purpose
> The purpose of this proposal is to develop an app to help disabled people with their school life. Unlike the existing app, which is the main consumer base, we plan to produce it on the web so that people with disabilities can easily request help according to their emotions. We also plan to help with reasonable consumption through donations.
>
> The production period for the containers used for production will be 06-23-2023 to 06-24-2023 for a total of 4 or less people.

## Project Prospect
> As the physical limitations of disabled people were overcome along with the development of IT technology in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, disabled people were able to play a much more important role than they do now. This means that many disabled people can have the opportunity to participate in society. However, many disabled people are unable to receive university education that allows them to acquire high-level skills and expertise in the digital high-tech era. Through these apps, the increasing number of students with disabilities entering college are improving their chances of adapting to school and entering society. Additionally, those of us who help can develop awareness of the society we live in and love for humanity by helping the socially underprivileged. Unlike existing apps, we have also targeted the disabled, who have been marginalized, as our consumer base, and we also plan to bring profitability through advertising through euros.
